👨🏻‍💻 I am a software engineer with professional experience in Web development. <br/>
😇  Worked with customers from USA and Ukraine.
   My practical knowledge of the most popular modern front-end technologies, such as React and Redux, allowed me to
   participate in projects where I managed to extend my experience with requirements gathering and customer
   communication.
